# Error Encountered:

## Configuration Errors:

Issue: Invalid YAML configuration (crash loop back)
Errors in the YAML configuration files used to deploy Prometheus or Grafana can cause deployment failures.
Solution:
Validated the YAML configuration files for syntax errors, indentation issues, and missing or incorrect field values.
Used command like kubectl apply --dry-run=client -f <file.yaml> to check the validity of YAML files before applying them to the cluster.

    
Issue: Missing ConfigMaps or Secrets
If required configuration files or secrets are missing, Prometheus or Grafana pods might fail to start.
Solution:
Ensured that all necessary ConfigMaps and Secrets are created and properly mounted into the Prometheus and Grafana pods.
Checked the existence and correctness of ConfigMaps and Secrets referenced in the pod specifications.

    
## Networking Issues:

Issue: Connection timeout
If there are network connectivity issues between Prometheus, Grafana, and other components in the cluster, you might encounter connection timeouts or errors.
Solution:
Verified network connectivity between Prometheus, Grafana, and their respective targets using command like ping, or curl.
Check for network policies or firewall rules blocking communication between the components.


## Grafana Dashboard:

No Data Displayed on Grafana Dashboard:

Even after adding a data source, no metrics were visible on the Grafana dashboard.

Solution: Review the queries configured in Grafana and ensure they match the available metrics. Adjust queries as needed to align with the metrics being collected, enabling data visualization on the Grafana dashboard.
